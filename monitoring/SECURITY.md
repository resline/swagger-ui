# Security Improvements: Filebeat Container Hardening

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements implemented to address the security issue where the Filebeat container was running as root user to access the Docker socket.

## Security Issue
**ORIGINAL PROBLEM**: Filebeat container ran as root user for Docker socket access, which increased the attack surface significantly.

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a **Docker Socket Proxy approach** which provides the highest level of security while maintaining full functionality.

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Docker Socket Proxy Container
- **Purpose**: Acts as a secure intermediary between Filebeat and the Docker daemon
- **Image**: `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:0.1.1`
- **Security Features**:
  - Runs as non-root user (`65534:65534`)
  - Read-only filesystem
  - No new privileges
  - Minimal permissions (only `CONTAINERS=1` enabled)
  - Isolated tmpfs for temporary files

#### 2. Custom Filebeat Container
- **Custom Dockerfile**: Creates a hardened Filebeat image
- **Security Features**:
  - Runs as non-root user (`1000:1000`)
  - Read-only filesystem
  - No new privileges
  - Health checks for monitoring
  - Proper file permissions and ownership

#### 3. Configuration Updates
- **Filebeat config**: Updated to use socket proxy instead of direct socket access
- **Docker Compose**: Comprehensive security hardening applied

## Security Improvements

### Before (Insecure Configuration)
```yaml
filebeat:
  image: docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:8.8.2
  user: root  # SECURITY RISK
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  # DIRECT SOCKET ACCESS
```

### After (Secure Configuration)
```yaml
# Secure Docker Socket Proxy
docker-socket-proxy:
  image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:0.1.1
  user: "65534:65534"
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  read_only: true
  environment:
    - CONTAINERS=1  # Only container info access
    # All other endpoints disabled

# Secure Filebeat
filebeat:
  build: ./monitoring/filebeat/Dockerfile  # Custom hardened image
  user: "1000:1000"
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  read_only: true
  # No direct Docker socket access
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: 
   - Filebeat no longer runs as root
   - Docker socket proxy only exposes necessary endpoints
   - Minimal attack surface

2. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Multiple security layers
   - Read-only filesystems
   - No privilege escalation
   - Isolated temporary directories

3. **Container Isolation**:
   - No direct Docker socket access
   - Proper user separation
   - Network segmentation maintained

4. **Auditability**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Traceable access patterns
   - Health monitoring enabled

## Maintained Functionality

- âœ… **Container Log Collection**: All Docker container logs are still collected
- âœ… **Nginx Log Ingestion**: File-based log collection continues to work
- âœ… **Elasticsearch Integration**: Log shipping to Elasticsearch maintained
- âœ… **Metadata Enhancement**: Docker metadata still added to logs
- âœ… **Health Monitoring**: Enhanced with proper health checks

## Zero Functionality Loss

The implementation ensures that:
1. All existing log collection continues to work
2. Docker container metadata is still available
3. Log processing and shipping remain intact
4. Monitoring and alerting capabilities are preserved
5. Performance is maintained or improved

## Deployment

1. **Build the custom Filebeat image**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build filebeat
   ```

2. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify security**:
   ```bash
   # Check that Filebeat is not running as root
   docker exec swagger-filebeat whoami  # Should return 'filebeat'
   
   # Verify socket proxy is working
   docker logs swagger-docker-socket-proxy
   
   # Test log collection
   docker logs swagger-filebeat
   ```

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Benefits
- âœ… Significantly reduced attack surface
- âœ… Better compliance with security best practices
- âœ… No functionality loss
- âœ… Improved container isolation
- âœ… Enhanced monitoring capabilities

### Considerations
- ðŸ“Š Additional container (socket proxy) in the stack
- ðŸ“Š Slightly more complex architecture
- ðŸ“Š Custom Filebeat build required

## Conclusion

The Docker Socket Proxy approach provides the optimal balance between security and functionality. It eliminates the need for Filebeat to run as root while maintaining full log collection capabilities. This solution follows industry best practices for container security and significantly reduces the attack surface without compromising any existing functionality.
